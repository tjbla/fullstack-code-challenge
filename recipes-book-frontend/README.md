# Front-end Code Challenge

Dear developer, in this test you will have to design the front-end of our recipes book app. You will find below the instructions to complete this challenge.

## Description

This repository implements the Front-end for a cooking recipe book. Notice that you already have the frontend conected to the api to show the stored recipes in json format.
You will need to implement the user stories to provide a usable and user friendly application.

### User stories

- As a user, I would like to see the list of recipes with the information asociated to each one of them.
- As a user, I would like to create my recipes.
- As a user, I would like to consult the recipes by searching by the name of the dish or the cooking time.

### What do we value?

- We'll look at how you structure the code, its readability, and documentation.
- The design of the application, how you present the information and your way of structuring it.
- Unit testing or any other functionality that adds value to the project/code will be taken into account.
